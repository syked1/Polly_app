##Database instructions

The db object in the flask _init_ file connects to the app.db file in the app directory.
It does this by reading the config file. The tables are defined as declaritive classes 
in the models.py module. These are subclasses of the db.model.

Step 1: Create the database and structures from the models class using:
db.create_all() - if you are overwriting use db.drop_all() first before db.create_all()

Step 2: To create a row of the database initialise an instance of the relevant table class
You then have to add this to the current session and then commit it to the database.

user = User(name="Name", email = "email")

db.session.add(user)
db.session.commit()
